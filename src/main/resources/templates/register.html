        Like a war file, a Spring Boot application is not intended to be used as a dependency. If your
        application contains classes that you want to share with other projects, the recommended approach
        is to move that code into a separate module. The separate module can then be depended upon by
        your application and other projects.
        If you cannot rearrange your code as recommended above, Spring Bootâ€™s Maven and Gradle plugins
        must be configured to produce a separate artifact that is suitable for use as a dependency. The
        executable archive cannot be used as a dependency as the executable jar format packages
        application classes in BOOT-INF/classes. This means that they cannot be found when the executable
        jar is used as a dependency.
        To produce the two artifacts, one that can be used as a dependency and one that is executable, a
        classifier must be specified. This classifier is applied to the name of the executable archive, leaving
        the default archive for use as a dependency.
